# synthetic_trial_amd

An emulated target trial comparing I) the bevacizumab arm (n 65) of the ABC trial --- a prospective, double-masked, multicentre randomised controlled trial undertaken in the United Kingdom during 2006–08 --- with II) a synthetic arm from 31,151 eyes receiving aflibercept during routine care across 27 sites in England during 2012–18.
